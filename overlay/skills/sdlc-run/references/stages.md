# sdlc-run stages — the milestone process

The detailed runbook for `SKILL.md`, as the owner approved it on 2026-10-09. Rules that hold in
every stage:

- **No design gates.** The engineer confirms twice: the intent (1.4), then UX plan, facts and
  tech plan together (4.3). Nobody else is a gate.
- **After the second confirmation the run is autonomous and always inside `/goal`.**
  `chain-gate.sh` refuses a source edit when the transcript holds no active goal.
- **One go is the default** (`sdlc.json` `delivery: "one-go"`, the owner's call on
  2026-10-25). Everything the engineer asked for goes into one change; the engineer pastes
  **one** `/goal` (`templates/goal/run.txt`) that builds every milestone of the plan in order.
  Features are commits; **no check, lint or test runs per feature or per commit**. Checks,
  E2E and validation run once per milestone, on that milestone's diff. One PR and one release
  per milestone. `delivery: "feature-prs"` keeps the older per-feature PRs (Stage 5, second
  half) for repos where several people build one milestone at once.
- **Questions never block.** When the build meets a question only the engineer can answer, it
  writes it to `changes/<id>/questions.md` (`Q<n>`, the question, the default it took, the
  milestone it affects), tells the engineer in one line, and keeps building on the default. An
  answer, whenever it arrives, is copied verbatim into the row and becomes an ask (`A<n>`) of
  the next milestone; a default the answer overturns is reworked there, not mid-milestone.
  Only `VERIFY BLOCKED` and an unfixable Critical or High stop the goal.
- **Feature checks run on what the feature touched; milestone checks on what the milestone
  changed.** Never the whole product.
- **Project values come from the repo.** Where sdlc.json, PRODUCT.md or DESIGN.md say nothing,
  the kit default applies and the report names it.
- **A step whose skill is not installed is skipped with a printed note** (`skipped: <skill> is
  not installed`), never silently, and the note goes into the report of that stage.

## Stage 1 — Intent

### 1.0 Preconditions

- **Steps:** Run `status.sh`; `templates=stale` → run `adopt` first. No `tracker` in `sdlc.json`:
  run `scripts/tracker.py detect`, ask, set it up (`references/trackers.md`). Check plannotator, the tracker
  MCP and `gh`; say once what is missing and continue where the chain allows.
- **Failure modes:** stale templates, no `sdlc.json`, missing `scripts/verify_gate.py`.

### 1.1 The dialog

- **Steps:**
  1. Search the tracker first with distinctive title words. Read `<designsDir>/INDEX.md`, one
     line per design and decision, and open only the files whose title or tags touch the
     ticket. Never read the whole designs folder, and never build on a line under `Replaced`.
  2. One `AskUserQuestion` with five forks: ticket, design file, size, kind, milestone. Each
     fork puts your pick first as `(Recommended)` with the reason, read from the ticket and the
     code: "M (Recommended): the ticket changes one screen's behaviour".
  3. Sizes, one line each: `none` no interface change; `S` words or visuals on an existing
     screen; `M` one screen's behaviour or one flow; `L` a new screen, flow or feature.
  4. Kind: `feature`, `bug`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`.
  5. Milestone: `new` (this change opens `milestone/<slug>`), `existing` (name it; this change
     adds its features to that milestone's `milestone.md`), `single` (a milestone of one: both
     checks on one change), `hotfix` (PRs to the default branch, feature checks only).
     When the engineer names several things at once, they are features of **one** change and
     one milestone, not one change each; the plan orders them.
  6. Project, asked only when the milestone fork was `new`: `none` (**recommended** — the
     milestone goes straight to the default branch), `new` (this change opens
     `project/<slug>`), `existing` (name it). A project is for work that will span several
     milestones; a single milestone never needs one.
  7. Write `decisions.json` first: `{"size", "kind", "milestone": {"kind", "slug"}, "ticket",
     "design"}`, plus `"project": {"kind", "slug"}` when the answer was not `none`. `design` is
     the design file's path or `"none"`. The `milestone` key marks a folder on this process.
- **Failure modes:** asking before searching the tracker; deciding a fork yourself; opening a
  project branch for a single milestone, which adds a level and buys nothing.

### 1.2 Folder, tracker, worktree, project and milestone branches

- **Steps:**
  1. Slug of at most four words. Create `changes/<today>-<slug>/`; nothing waits for the tracker.
  2. Attach to the named issue, create one for `new` (minimal first, then update; retry twice),
     or none, at the level `references/trackers.md` gives for this tool. A Linear key: `git mv`
     to `changes/<today>-<KEY>-<slug>/` and set `linear:`; a GitHub or Beads id: `decisions.json` `ticket`.
  3. Project first, when `decisions.json` has one and `kind` is `new`:
     `git push origin origin/<defaultBranch>:refs/heads/project/<slug>`. An `existing` project
     is already on the remote; confirm it with `git ls-remote --exit-code origin
     project/<slug>` rather than assuming.
     Then `new` or `single`:
     `git push origin <parent>:refs/heads/milestone/<slug>`, where `<parent>` is
     `origin/project/<slug>` when the change has a project and `origin/<defaultBranch>`
     otherwise. Create or attach the tracker's milestone for it. `hotfix` cuts no milestone
     branch.
  4. Write `milestone.md` from the template for `new` and `single`; for `existing`, add a row to
     the named milestone's `milestone.md`. When the change names a design, add one line for it
     under that design's `## Milestones` (the guardrail test and `status` both read it).
  5. The worktree, from the main checkout (`ExitWorktree keep` first when in one):
     `git fetch origin && git worktree add --no-track -b <branch> .worktrees/<slug> <base>`,
     then `EnterWorktree path=<repo>/.worktrees/<slug>`. `<base>` is `origin/milestone/<slug>`
     for a milestone change, `origin/<defaultBranch>` for a hotfix; `<branch>` contains the slug.
     Never `EnterWorktree name=<slug>@<branch>`: the tool allows only letters, digits, `.`,
     `_`, `-` and `/` in a name, and the WorktreeCreate hook always cuts from the default branch.
- **Failure modes:** a duplicate ticket, a worktree outside `.worktrees/`, a branch name without
  the slug (the hooks then cannot find the change), a feature branch cut from the default branch
  instead of the milestone branch (a milestone of one hides it: both are the same commit).

### 1.3 Asks

- **Steps:**
  1. Collect sources in order: ticket, conversation, the owner-words file from `docs/ux/setup.md`,
     then every `sdlc.json` `feedback` file since the last archived change for the same screen.
     Copy each request verbatim into `intent.md` `## Asks` as `A1`, `A2`, …;
     copy resources into `changes/<id>/asks/<source-date>/` and link them.
  2. Copy each Snapmark export whole into `changes/<id>/asks/<session-date>-snapmark/`:
     `session.md`, `img/`, and any PDF or zip. Never re-encode the images.
     Run `python3 scripts/marks.py init <id>`. Every numbered note becomes an `A<n>`, quoting
     the owner's words with its mark id. Every ask still lands in a fact or `## Out of scope`.
  3. The same command inventories reference images in `asks/` and `spec/prototype/`.
     Rerun it when sources arrive; keep filled rows and resolve reported orphans.
- **Failure modes:** a dropped or paraphrased ask; a link to `/Users/`, `~/` or `file://`.

### 1.4 Draft the intent; the engineer confirms

- **Steps:**
  1. The agent drafts the rest of `intent.md`: job stories with an evidence label each
     (**observed**, **reported**, **assumed**), the success measure (one number, where it is
     read, the target), problem, outcome, constraints. Infer; ask only what the engineer alone
     knows.
  2. `python3 scripts/verify_gate.py lint <id>`; fix every line it names.
  3. Show the draft in five lines: the asks, the job stories, the success measure. Then one
     `AskUserQuestion`: "Confirm (Recommended)" with why the draft covers every ask, or "Edit".
     Never skipped.
  4. `status: approved`, `reviewed_by`, `approved_at`; commit `changes(<id>): intent confirmed by <who>`.
- **Gate:** touchpoint one. `chain-gate.sh` refuses `spec/**` and `facts.md` before it.

## Stage 2 — UX plan

Skipped for size `none` and for `sdlc.json` `ux: off`, with one printed line.

- **Steps:**
  1. `cct:ux-design <change>`: brief, IA, interaction, screens into `spec/`. Size S skips to 3.
  2. `cct:ux-sitemap-create diff <change>`: the sitemap change this makes.
  3. `cct:ux-conformance spec <change>`: the component table — exists / adapt / new, with paths.
  4. `cct:microcopy-write`: every changed word, in every language in `sdlc.json` `languages`.
  5. `cct:ux-validate spec <change>` **once**, sizes M and L. No loop: its findings go into
     `plan.md` (a fix in the spec now, or a Risk row), and the run continues.
  6. Prototype images only when the plan marks the UI risky (a new pattern, a dense screen, a
     flow nobody has drawn): `cct:designs-explore spec <change>`. Otherwise none.
- **Output:** `spec/*`. **Gate:** none.
- **Failure modes:** a validation loop (the old process's cost), images drawn by default.

## Stage 3 — Facts

- **Steps:**
  1. Read `references/requirements-grammar.md`. Draft `facts.md` after the UX plan.
  2. Every fact cites asks `(A1, A3)`, names its screen or state, and names the E2E tag that
     will prove it (`@F1` in the test title). A one-sentence change gets one plain fact.
  3. Every ask maps to a fact or to `## Out of scope`.
  4. `python3 scripts/verify_gate.py lint <id>` over intent, facts and plan.
- **Gate:** none; `chain-gate.sh` refuses `facts.md` before the UX plan is done or skipped.

## Stage 4 — Tech plan and the one gate

### 4.1 Plan

- `plan.md` from the template: Approach (with what was rejected), **Where things go** (a folder
  for every new file), **Feature PRs** (ordered, each with its facts and branch), Files that
  change, Order of work with a proof per step, Risks (including the validate findings), Done,
  **Goal handover**: one go, a single filled `templates/goal/run.txt` (turns from
  `goal.runTurns`); feature PRs, one filled `templates/goal/feature.txt` per feature
  (`goal.featureTurns`).
- `done.json`: facts with their tags, pages, states, widths, turn caps — the criteria as data.
- **Decisions get their own file.** A choice worth its reasons in a year is a new ADR,
  `<designsDir>/<date>-adr-<slug>.md`, with `supersedes` when it replaces one; set the old
  one's `status: superseded` and `superseded_by`. **Design changes** edit the design's
  sections in place. A design states what is true now: never append a "Since <ticket>"
  paragraph or a dated entry to it. Then `python3 scripts/design_index.py write`.
- A decision that changes or rules out a Snapmark note is an ADR too. Put its repo-relative
  path in that `marks.json` row's `decision`; set `expected` to what must now be visible.
  Read `<designsDir>/INDEX.md` and the relevant ADRs before refining the owner's words.

### 4.2 Calls, when relevant

`cct:architecture-review` (new service or boundary), `data-model-create` (schema),
`api-design` (endpoint), `security-review` (auth, money, consent), `dependency-review` (new
package), `tracking-apply` (the success-measure events). Each result lands in the plan.

### 4.3 The gate

1. Say in five lines what the plan builds, the feature PRs in order, and the biggest risk with
   your recommendation for it. Then `plannotator annotate changes/<id>/plan.md --gate`; the plan
   links `spec/` and `facts.md`, so one gate covers all three. `planGate: self` only when no risk touches data safety,
   irreversible writes, security or money.
2. Annotated: revise and re-gate. Approved: set `status: approved` on facts and plan.
3. `python3 scripts/verify_gate.py approve <id>` writes `lock.json` (facts, done.json, checks).
4. Commit `changes(<id>): approved by <who>`. One tracker comment with the folder permalink.
5. One tracker sub-issue per row of `## Feature PRs`, under the change's issue (minimal first,
   then update; retry twice). Write each key into its row in `milestone.md`. Feature branches
   and PR titles carry that key, never the change's key (`references/trackers.md`, "Which merge
   closes what"). No tracker, or a tool without sub-issues: skip with a printed line.

## Stage 5 — Build, inside /goal

### One go (default)

One `/goal` from `templates/goal/run.txt` (turns: `goal.runTurns`) runs Stage 5 and Stage 6
for every milestone of the plan, back to back. The plan's `## Milestones` groups the features;
a change small enough for one milestone has one.

1. Milestone `n` works on `milestone/<slug>-<n>`, cut from `milestone/<slug>-<n-1>` (the first
   from `origin/<default>`), so the build never waits for a merge.
2. Per feature, in order: write the tests for its facts (`cct:e2e-write`, tagged `@F<n>`;
   bugs: `behavior-test-writer`, then `fix-implementer`), build in the plan's folders, commit,
   set the row in `milestone.md` to `done <sha>`, start the next feature at once. **Nothing
   runs between features**: no `verify_gate.py feature`, no lint, no tests, no CI, no UX review.
   A commit that breaks something is found by the milestone's checks, which is the point.
3. Features that edit different files may build in parallel worktrees cut from the milestone
   branch (Wall clock below); the supervisor merges them into the milestone branch locally.
4. When every feature of the milestone is `done`, Stage 6 runs for it in the same goal, and the
   next milestone's build continues while its PR waits on CI.

### Feature PRs (`delivery: "feature-prs"`)

- **Preconditions:** the milestone branch is rebased on **its parent** when that moved —
  `origin/project/<slug>` when the change has a project, `origin/<defaultBranch>` otherwise
  (`git rebase` in the milestone worktree, push with lease); each next feature's worktree is cut from
  it the way 1.2 step 5 says. In a project, rebase the project branch on the default branch
  first, then the milestone on the project: rebasing the milestone straight onto the trunk
  replays the other milestones' commits into it.
- **Steps (the goal runs these):**
  1. Start `/goal` with the feature's condition from `## Goal handover`.
  2. Tests first: `cct:e2e-write` for the feature's facts, tagged `@F<n>`. The feature's
     journey row in `e2e/journeys.md` is added or updated in the same PR: tier, states and
     specs (`../e2e-test-run/references/strategy.md` section 2.8).
     Bugs: `behavior-test-writer` writes the failing test, `testLocked: true`, then
     `fix-implementer`.
  3. Build in the plan's folders. A file elsewhere is `scope-growth`: stop and ask.
  4. `cct:e2e-test-run` on the feature tags locally, in the feature's own worktree and E2E
     slot, in the foreground (see Wall clock below); `flaky-test-fix` for an inconsistent test.
  5. `python3 scripts/verify_gate.py feature <id>`, once per feature at the end, never after a
     task group; between edits run only the test files the change touched, since the gate is
     the only full check. On `FAIL`, fix and rerun until `VERIFY PASS`: passed checks on an
     unchanged tree are cached, and the third failed run blocks with `reason=attempts`. On `BLOCKED`: one
     `AskUserQuestion` naming the reason in plain words, two or three ways forward, your pick
     first as `(Recommended)` with why.
  6. `cct:pr-create --base milestone/<slug>` (hotfix: the default branch), auto-merge not
     yet armed. The branch and title carry the feature's sub-issue key, never the change's key.
  7. UX check on the feature's own screens: `cct:ux-review <pr>`, run from the feature's
     worktree and E2E slot. Capture every changed screen and control open.
     For a marked screen or referenced wireframe, run `python3 scripts/marks.py init <id>`;
     capture that screen and state headless at the mark's width (Stage 6's headless rule).
     Open both the mark or reference image and the fresh shot; fill the rows this feature touches.
     Keep fresh shots under `changes/<id>/verify/shots/`, with change-relative paths in `shot`.
     Open every captured image with the image-reading tool. Require the
     review's visual ledger and one convention verdict per issue: `violates` with a quoted
     rule, `allowed by` with its decision or exception (remove from fixes), or `no convention`
     (keep it; propose `cct:ux-decision`). Run the Laws of UX and conformance passes too.
     Fix Critical and High findings in this PR, in one round; recapture and inspect the fixes.
     After the fixes rerun only the visual check, not the whole gate. Run step 5 once more with
     `--visual-check "<checker>" --visual-run "<run>"` only after the last fix commit, because
     its PASS sha must equal HEAD; use the
     checker path and current run returned by `cct:ux-review`. A failed check means the review
     did not run; the gate and report must say FAIL or BLOCKED. An earlier PASS cannot clear it.
     Medium and below stay for the milestone review,
     which sees the same screens. Never post its comments. Skipped with a printed line when
     `sdlc.json` `ux` is `off`, the size is `none`, or the PR changes no interface file.
     Supplied marks and reference images still require comparison, even when the UX skill is skipped.
  8. Arm auto-merge. PR CI runs the full E2E suite; fix until mergeable. This PR is
     **interior** (its base is `milestone/<slug>`, not the default branch), so the Claude
     review does not run on it, and no human is asked to approve it. The review workflow skips
     itself on the base ref. The code is reviewed once, on the PR that reaches the default
     branch.
  9. On merge: the feature's row in `milestone.md` → `merged`; the next feature starts.
- **Failure modes:** an edit outside `/goal` (refused), a protected-path edit (refused), a test
  edited to pass.

## Wall clock: one worktree per builder

A milestone spent three hours between "every feature done" and "PR merged" (omr-leadhub audit M6,
2026-10-10), and almost none of it was work that had to wait. Every builder and every E2E run
shared one checkout and one port, so nothing could overlap. These rules make the waiting
disappear.

- **One worktree per builder.** Each feature or fix-part builder runs in its own worktree at
  `<repo>/.worktrees/<feature>` (an `Agent` of type `cct:builder` with `isolation: "worktree"`, or the 1.2 recipe),
  cuts its branch from `milestone/<slug>` there, and never checks out the milestone branch. The
  supervisor's worktree holds the milestone branch and does the merges. Independent features
  build at the same time. Features that edit the same files run one after another, the second
  cut after the first has merged.
- **The supervisor plans, dispatches, judges and merges.** The session that runs this skill edits
  no code and runs no test suite; the builders and the gate do. Every feature and fix part goes to
  an `cct:builder`, never to `general-purpose`. A subagent's result comes back as a file path
  plus a summary of at most about 2k tokens. At most 4 builders run at once.
- **Isolate each worktree's E2E resources.** Give its run an app port, stub port, database and
  logs, derived from the worktree path. A repo that hard-codes a port or database name gets
  one env var per value first. Schedule runs under the lock and load policy in
  `../../e2e-test-run/references/suite-speed-and-reliability.md` section F.
- **Builders never wait on background work.** E2E and long gates run in the foreground with a
  long tool timeout. A builder that parks on its own background job stalls the supervisor and
  the next builder.
- **Fit and width assertions keep slack.** CI's Linux fonts render wider than a Mac. A test that
  asserts text fits its box requires text ≤ 0.9 × the box, or a measured wrap, so a pass on a Mac
  is a pass on CI. Before the milestone PR, where a container runtime exists, run the fit specs
  once in the Playwright Linux image.
- **The milestone review does not wait for the last feature.** Start the Stage 6 review on the
  merged features while the last one builds, and review the last one's diff when it lands. Start
  the full E2E run at the same time as the review, not after it.
- **The fix round runs in parallel parts.** Split the findings by the files they touch, give each
  part its own builder and worktree, and run the parts at once. Don't hold the fix round for an
  E2E result: dispatch the review's findings at once and add an E2E failure to the part that
  owns its files when it arrives.
- **Fixtures belong to the spec.** Every spec makes its own tenant or business unit and deletes
  it after, so parallel runs and later specs never read another spec's rows.

## Stage 6 — Milestone, inside /goal

Scope: `git diff <parent>...milestone/<slug>` only, where `<parent>` is
`origin/project/<slug>` when the change has a project and `origin/<defaultBranch>` otherwise.
Diffing a project's milestone against the trunk pulls in the sibling milestones already
merged into the project branch, and reviews them again.

Capture real screenshots headless: `agent-browser` CLI first (OMR's standard), or Playwright
headless through the repo's E2E setup. This is reproducible, works in CI, and never uses the
person's own browser session. Never use Claude in Chrome or any tool driving that browser.

1. One go: the same goal continues from Stage 5. Feature PRs: start `/goal` with
   `templates/goal/milestone.txt` filled (`goal.milestoneTurns`).
2. Run on the diff, each once and in parallel: `cct:ux-review`, `cct:pr-review`,
   `cct:responsive-audit` (the `responsiveTier` matrix, nothing overflows), the states of
   every changed page, `cct:accessibility-audit`, the full E2E suite once, ×3 only for
   changed and flaky specs. Use the committed `e2e/flaky-specs.txt` list and the selection
   and line-format rules in `../../e2e-test-run/references/suite-speed-and-reliability.md`
   section G. Send inconsistent results to `flaky-test-fix`. Also run `cct:ux-audit` only
   when the change adds a screen,
   `cct:ux-validate build`, the `cct:verifier` and `cct:ac-auditor` agents for job
   stories and facts, `cct:security-review` when auth, money or consent is touched.
   The review starts while the last feature builds, and the full E2E starts with it, not after.
   Require the shared visual pass from each UX run: open every image, including responsive
   and state captures, and validate each issue against the repo's documents with the same
   three verdicts as Stage 5. Include late feature captures before the final check.
   Run `python3 scripts/marks.py init <id>`, then capture every marked and referenced screen
   headless into `verify/shots/`. Match the screen, state and width, including populated fixtures
   and open controls; an admin screen cannot prove a partner-screen fix.
   Open each original/build pair with the image-reading tool and fill every `marks.json` row
   against the owner's words as refined by its ADR. Reuse the shared visual pass and its ledger;
   `marks.json` records the comparison, not a second inspection ledger. Missing states are coverage
   gaps, not inferred passes. A `ruled-out` note needs its ADR, not a screenshot.
2a. **Validation: does each feature do what the plan said?** Separate from the checks, which
   prove the code is sound. For every fact and every ask of this milestone, exercise the
   built app (E2E with the fact's tag, a headless capture of the named screen and state, or
   the `cct:verifier` agent driving the flow) and write one row to
   `changes/<id>/validation.md`: `F<n>/A<n>`, expected (the fact's words), observed (what the
   app did), evidence (test name, shot path, command output), verdict `met`, `not met` or
   `partly`. A `not met` or `partly` row is a blocking finding. `cct:ac-auditor` grades the
   same rows against the code; where it and the observed behaviour disagree, the behaviour
   wins and the row says so. Also list the open `questions.md` rows and the default each took.
3. One `changes/<id>/findings.md`: blocking items first, advisory after. Link the visual
   ledgers and checks. A missing or failed visual check is BLOCKED: the review did not run.
   Run `python3 scripts/marks.py check <id>`; open rows are blocking findings.
   A `fixed` row names the passing test tag that proves it in `test` (`@F<n>`); the tag must
   appear in a `testGlobs` file or the check fails.
   Only the engineer's words in `accepted` can accept a non-fixed row; never infer acceptance.
4. One fix round: `cct:review-fix-loop 1` (the `1` is `max_iterations`; always pass it) on the blocking items only, split into parallel
   parts by the files they touch, one builder and worktree per part. What is left, or new
   scope, becomes a change in the next milestone.
5. Reopen recaptured images and rerun their visual checks. Then
   `python3 scripts/verify_gate.py milestone <id> --visual-check "<checker>" --visual-run "<run>"`
   once, after the fixes, never between them; on `FAIL` fix and rerun until `VERIFY PASS` (passed
   checks on an unchanged tree are cached; the third failed run blocks with `reason=attempts`).
   Repeat `--visual-run` for every required current UX run; failures enter
   `verify/report.json` and `report.md` as failed checks. Resolve the checker from the installed
   `omr-ux` skill, never a cross-plugin relative path. Omit visual flags only for explicitly
   recorded UX skips. An older gate without these flags needs `sdlc-run adopt`, not a bypass.
   The milestone gate also runs `marks.py check` as `owner-marks` when sessions or `marks.json`
   exist, independently of `sdlc.json` checks or UX skips. Paste `python3 scripts/marks.py table <id>`
   into the milestone report, including accepted gaps. A file check proves coverage, not pixels.
6. One PR `milestone/<slug>` → **its parent** (`project/<slug>`, else the default branch) with
   the report, `validation.md` and `Closes <KEY>` for the change's issue. One go: milestone `n`
   opens its PR into the default branch once milestone `n-1` has merged (`git rebase --onto
   origin/<default> milestone/<slug>-<n-1>` first); the build of `n+1` goes on meanwhile.
   Into a project it is an interior PR:
   no Claude review, auto-merge armed on green. Into the default branch it gets the Claude
   review and merges by the repo's branch protection, auto-merge armed on green. **The engineer accepts the milestone** in one `AskUserQuestion`: "Accept
   (Recommended)" with the one-line reason, or "Hold" with what is left. One go: no dialog;
   auto-merge is armed on green and the engineer reads `validation.md` in the PR. The dialog
   comes only when a Critical or High would be deferred.

## Stage 6p — Project, inside /goal

Only when `decisions.json` has a `project`, and only once every milestone of it has merged
into `project/<slug>`.

1. Rebase `project/<slug>` on `origin/<defaultBranch>` and push with lease.
2. Re-run `checks.milestone` on `git diff origin/<defaultBranch>...project/<slug>` — the whole
   project as one diff. The per-milestone reviews each saw one slice; this is the first time
   anything looks at the seams between them.
3. One PR `project/<slug>` → default branch. **This is the PR that CI reviews**: the first and
   only one in the whole chain that does. Auto-merge armed on green.
4. **The engineer accepts the project** in one `AskUserQuestion`. No second fix round: what is
   left becomes the next project's first change.

## Stage 7 — Outcome and archive

1. When the change reaches the default branch: `git mv changes/<id> changes/archive/<year>/<year-month>/<id>`,
   set `archived_at`, commit `changes(<id>): archived`, comment the merge SHA in the tracker,
   `ExitWorktree keep`, then `git worktree remove .worktrees/<slug>` (a worktree entered by path
is never removed by `ExitWorktree`). Move the tracker forward only, never backwards.
2. After release: read the success measure from PostHog (`omr-ai-os:posthog-*` or the insight
   named in `intent.md`) and write it under `## Outcome` in `milestone.md`.
3. A miss starts the next change at 1.3, with the measurement as its first ask.
