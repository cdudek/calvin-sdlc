## How work moves: the SDLC

This repo uses `cct:sdlc-run`, configured by `sdlc.json`. A change is one PR and one folder:
`{{CHANGES_DIR}}/<date>-<KEY>-<slug>/` (no key when there is no Linear issue). Designs that outlive
one PR live in `{{DESIGNS_DIR}}/`, one decision per file. Read `{{DESIGNS_DIR}}/INDEX.md` first and
open only the files it points you to; `python3 scripts/design_index.py write` after adding one.
The seven stages are Intent, UX plan,
Facts, Tech plan, Build, Milestone and Outcome.

The agent drafts intent, UX plan, facts and plan; the engineer confirms the intent, then all
three documents in one gate. After that every feature is built inside `/goal` as a PR into
`milestone/<slug>`, and ends on `python3 scripts/verify_gate.py feature <id>`. Each milestone
gets the heavy checks once, then one PR to its parent.

Branches:

```
<default> ─── milestone/<slug> ─── <feature branches>             one milestone
<default> ─── project/<slug> ─── milestone/<slug> ─── <features>  a project
```

A `project/<slug>` branch exists only for work spanning several milestones; one milestone
needs none.

**Only the PR into the default branch is reviewed.** Feature PRs into `milestone/*` and
milestone PRs into `project/*` are interior merges inside one change: no Claude review,
auto-merge on their checks alone.

That PR merges by the repo's own branch protection: auto-merge on green.


New keys: `checks`, `milestones`, `projects`, `hotfix`, `goal`, `languages`, `responsiveTier`,
`ux`, `protected`. The reference is
**[{{DOCS}}]({{DOCS}})**.

## Verifying your work

    {{VERIFY}}

Run it before reporting done. If a test fails, fix the code, not the test. The Stop hook runs
`{{VERIFY_STOP}}` for dirty source files.
