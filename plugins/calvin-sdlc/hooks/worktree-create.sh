# Every worktree lands at <repo>/.worktrees/<name>. No exceptions, no siblings.
#
# 2026-09-12: three worktrees were created at ~/projects/omr/<name> — siblings of the
# repo, in the projects dir. The equivalent plugin hook was not active (the omr-dev
# plugin is not in enabledPlugins), so Claude Code's built-in placement ran instead.
# This copy lives in ~/.claude/hooks and is registered directly in settings.json, so
# it cannot be switched off by a plugin being disabled.
#
# Unlike the plugin version, an absolute or ./relative path does NOT escape: it is
# reduced to its basename under .worktrees/. "Never ever anywhere else" is the rule.
#
# Format: name[@target-branch[@base-branch]] or @target-branch[@base-branch]
#   my-feature                     -> .worktrees/my-feature, branch my-feature from origin/master
#   my-feature@feat/login          -> .worktrees/my-feature, branch feat/login from origin/master
#   my-feature@feat/login@develop  -> .worktrees/my-feature, branch feat/login from develop
#   @feat/login                    -> .worktrees/login, branch feat/login from origin/master

# THAT clone and the new worktree landed at .worktrees/data-model-repository/.worktrees/<name>

# hides from `ls .worktrees/` at the level anyone actually looks.

# If GIT_ROOT sits under a .worktrees/ directory, climb to the parent of the OUTERMOST one.
# That is the workspace root whatever the checkout layout underneath happens to be.
