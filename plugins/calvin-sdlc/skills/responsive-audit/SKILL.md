description: Audits responsive design both code-wise and visually — greps the code for known overflow smells, then screenshots the running app at 360/768/1280px with the agent-browser CLI, measures real horizontal overflow, and judges the rendered layout. Use when user says "responsive audit", "check screen sizes", "mobile layout check", "does this work on mobile", "test different viewports", "check for overflow", or after building/redesigning a UI surface.

# Responsive Design Audit

Two-phase audit of one or more UI surfaces: a static code pass for the layout patterns that
break small viewports, then visual verification against the running app at a tiered,
usage-share-weighted viewport matrix (3 / 6 / 15 sizes bracketing ≈95% of real-world
viewports — see Phase B).
Code-only audits miss data-dependent blowouts (long German labels, wide countdown pills);
screenshot-only audits can't tell you which line to fix. Do both, in this order.

## Prerequisites

| Variable / Dependency | Required | Format | How to obtain |
|-----------------------|----------|--------|---------------|
| `agent-browser` CLI | Yes (Phase B) | on PATH | `npm i -g agent-browser && agent-browser install` (Node 24+) |
| Running dev server | Yes (Phase B) | e.g. `http://localhost:3000` | the project's dev command |
| Auth seam for gated surfaces | If auditing auth'd pages | project-specific | check the project's e2e auth helpers / test personas / dev bypass |

The in-kit `/calvin-sdlc:browser-automate` skill documents agent-browser CLI usage
(navigation, screenshots, JS eval) — reference it rather than guessing commands.

## Phase A — code audit (no browser)

Grep the target surface's components for the known overflow smells. Report candidates as
`file:line` with the smell name; these are hypotheses for Phase B, not confirmed findings.

1. **Grid/flex children with unbounded content and no `min-w-0`** — CSS auto tracks size to
   the content's min-width, so a long badge or subject line inflates the track and blows the
   page out sideways. Look for `grid`/`flex` containers whose children hold user data
   (names, emails, subjects, prices) without `min-w-0` on the child.
2. **`truncate` on a flex child whose ancestors can't shrink** — `truncate` only works if
   every ancestor between it and the sized container allows shrinking (`min-w-0`). A
   `truncate` that "doesn't work" is almost always this.
3. **Fixed widths in non-wrapping rows** — `w-64`, `w-56`, `w-[..px]` inside a `flex` row
   without `flex-wrap`. Fine at desktop, guaranteed overflow at 360px.
4. **Multi-button/badge rows without `flex-wrap`** — action rows, chip strips, toolbar rows.
5. **Tables not wrapped in an `overflow-x-auto` container** — wide tables must scroll inside
   their own container; the page body must never scroll horizontally.
6. **Absolutely positioned elements near text** — overlays, pills, and stars anchored over
   content can cover the focal figure when a sibling grows (check what happens when the
   neighbor's text is long).

## Phase B — visual verification (agent-browser)

Confirm `command -v agent-browser` first; if missing, STOP and surface the install command —
never silently skip the visual pass.

### The viewport matrix (evidence-based, StatCounter June 2026)

All sizes are **CSS viewport pixels** — what media queries and layout respond to — never
hardware pixels (a Retina/QHD panel maps 2–3 physical px to 1 CSS px; DPR only matters for
image sharpness, not layout). Device mix worldwide: **mobile 51.5% / desktop 47.1% /
tablet 1.4%** (StatCounter, June 2026).

Pick the tier by task size; every tier is a strict subset of the next:

**Quick (3) — any UI change:** `360x800` · `768x1024` · `1920x1080`
**Standard (6) — new surfaces / redesigns:** + `390x844` · `1280x720` · `1440x900`
**Full (15) — audits / pre-launch:** the whole matrix below.

| Viewport | Class | Represents | Share (worldwide, mobile/desktop/tablet-relative) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 360x800 | Phone | Samsung Galaxy A/S (top Android) | 9.2% of mobile |
| 375x812 | Phone | iPhone X/12–13 mini/SE gen 2–3 | 6.0% (13.6% in DE — #2) |
| 390x844 | Phone | iPhone 12–16 base models | 6.3% |
| 393x873 | Phone | Pixel + Android flagships (393x852 = iPhone 15/16 Pro) | 4.5% (+iPhone Pro tail) |
| 414x896 | Phone | iPhone XR/11, Plus models | 12.1% — #1 worldwide AND #1 in DE (16.3%) |
| 430x932 | Phone | iPhone 14–16 Pro Max/Plus — widest mainstream phone | long-tail upper bracket |
| 768x1024 | Tablet | iPad classic portrait (= the `md` breakpoint) | 9.8% of tablet |
| 820x1180 | Tablet | iPad 10th gen (brackets the 800/810/820 cluster) | ~18% of tablet cluster |
| 1280x720 | Laptop | small/older laptops; also brackets MacBook Air 1280x800/832 logical | 6.0% of desktop |
| 1366x768 | Laptop | legacy budget laptops (still everywhere in B2B) | 5.7% |
| 1440x900 | Laptop | 13" MacBook default scaled resolution | MacBook cluster |
| 1536x864 | Laptop | Windows 125%-scaled 1920 panels; proxies 14" MBP (1512x982) | 6.9% |
| 1728x1117 | Laptop | 16" MacBook Pro logical; brackets 1600x900/1680x1050 | Mac/HiDPI cluster |
| 1920x1080 | Desktop | dominant monitor resolution | 20.2% (24.4% in DE — #1) |
| 2560x1440 | Desktop | large monitors — max-width/container behavior check | 5.6% in DE |

**Coverage method:** viewports between two tested widths are covered by their stricter
neighbor (a layout that survives 360 and 375 survives 368), so the matrix is judged by
*bracketing*: the six phone widths bracket the 360–430 band where virtually all modern
phones render; the desktop set brackets 1280–2560 (4K panels browse at 200% scaling =
1920 logical); tablets bracket 768–820 portrait (landscape ≈ the 1280 laptop entry).
Weighted by the device mix, the matrix brackets **≈95% of real-world viewports**.
Excluded as sub-1% tails: <360 legacy phones (320x568 remains a useful stress floor if
copy-overflow is suspected), unfolded foldables (~673–800, tablet-adjacent), and
unscaled ultrawide/4K. German market note: DE mobile skews iPhone (414/375/390 are the
DE top-3) — for German-market products, test the iPhone widths before the Android ones.

For EVERY target surface, at every width in the chosen tier:

1. **Screenshot TWICE** and store both in a scratch directory:
   - **Viewport shot** (no fullPage) — what the user sees above the fold. Judge fold
     placement here, never on the full-page image.
   - **Full-page shot** (fullPage) — everything below the fold; long pages hide their
     breakage in footers and late sections. Scroll to the bottom once first so
     lazy-loaded content is in the DOM, then capture. Known capture artifact: fixed
     headers/toasts render once at the top of a full-page shot — not a bug.
   If the surface has meaningful STATE, re-shoot after driving it (a selected row, an
   opened accordion/dialog, a filled form, a row with maximum-length real data) — the
   worst blowouts are data- and state-dependent and invisible on the initial render.
2. **Measure real overflow** via JS eval:
   ```js
   document.documentElement.scrollWidth - window.innerWidth  // flag > 1px
   ```
3. **When overflow is found, enumerate the offenders** instead of guessing — eval:
   ```js
   [...document.querySelectorAll("*")]
     .filter(el => el.getBoundingClientRect().right > window.innerWidth + 1)
     .map(el => `${el.tagName}.${el.className} w=${Math.round(el.getBoundingClientRect().width)}`)
   ```
   The narrowest offender with real content is usually the culprit; its ancestors are
   collateral. `position: fixed` overlays (toasts) appear here but do NOT cause document
   scroll — false positives.
4. **LOOK at every screenshot** and judge against this protocol (this is where automated
   checks go blind). Work the groups in order:

   **Above the fold (viewport shot):**
   - Is the surface's primary purpose visible without scrolling — key heading, primary
     CTA, the number/status the user came for? On phones, banners + nav can eat the fold.
   - Does the fold cut an element so it LOOKS complete when it isn't (a card row whose
     continuation is hidden, a form whose submit is just below the cut)?

   **Text:**
   - Truncated labels/values (German runs ~30% longer — readable EN can be "ZEITHO…" in DE)
   - Mid-word breaks and ugly hyphenation of long German compounds
   - Orphans: a single word alone on the last line of a heading; awkward two-line splits
     of short labels ("Speichern" wrapping under its icon)
   - Text split around inline elements (an amount separated from its unit/preposition)
   - Line length: body prose past ~75ch on wide screens, or squeezed under ~20ch in a
     starved column
   - Text overlapping other text or controls (absolute positioning, negative margins)

   **Layout anomalies:**
   - Squashed or overlapping elements (especially positioned pills over prices/labels)
   - Uneven card heights in one row; columns that lost alignment
   - Large unexplained empty regions (collapsed/failed content) or a single element
     stretched absurdly wide (missing max-width — form fields spanning 2560px)
   - Nested/duplicate scrollbars; content escaping rounded corners; grid blowouts
   - Button/badge rows that wrapped into a broken-looking state

   **Interactive & fixed elements:**
   - Targets under 24x24 CSS px whose 24 px circle touches another target (WCAG 2.5.8 AA,
     a finding); 44x44 on phone primary targets is a recommendation (WCAG 2.5.5 AAA, a note)
   - Hover-only affordances with no touch equivalent
   - Sticky/fixed headers, bars, or toasts covering content or the primary CTA
     (especially at short/landscape heights)

   **Media & brand:**
   - Stretched, squished, or blurry images; broken aspect ratios at odd crops
   - Wrong logo/color variant against the background at any breakpoint; text on images
     losing contrast at a different crop

   **Accessibility tie-ins** (report as findings with the criterion):
   - WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow: no two-dimensional scrolling at 320px width (equivalent to
     400% zoom on a 1280 desktop) — run the 320x568 stress floor when auditing
   - WCAG 1.4.4: page still usable at 200% browser text zoom (spot-check one surface)

Report "OK" for a surface x width ONLY after actually viewing BOTH its screenshots.

## Output

A findings table — surface x width, severity (high/medium/low), the offending element
(`file:line` when Phase A identified it), and a concrete fix suggestion (usually one of:
`min-w-0` on the grid/flex child, `flex-wrap` on the row, `shrink-0` on the badge,
`overflow-x-auto` container, or wrapping instead of truncating).

## Lock it in — regression guard

If the project has a Playwright e2e suite, recommend encoding the audit as a permanent
360px no-horizontal-overflow guard over the key surfaces:

```ts
const MOBILE = { width: 360, height: 800 } as const;
test.use({ viewport: MOBILE });

test("no horizontal overflow @360", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(path, { waitUntil: "networkidle" });
  const overflow = await page.evaluate(
    () => document.documentElement.scrollWidth - window.innerWidth,
  );
  expect(overflow, `${path}: ${overflow}px overflow at 360px`).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1);
});
```

Auth-gated surfaces that can't join a generic guard spec (feature flags, per-user gates) get
the same check inside their own spec, in the state with the widest content on screen.
