"""Regression guards for pr-review contracts that a real audit found broken.

Two shapes of defect, both silent at runtime, which is why they need a guard.

First: a rule or script needs an input and the only file that could supply it
never does — the reviewer guesses, or GitHub drops a comment with no error.

Second: the posted comment. What a PR author reads is decided by one jq filter
and one layout section, and every failure there lands on somebody else's PR —
a thread over a variable name, an unconfirmed claim phrased as a defect, or a
finding posted without the reason the pipeline already computed.
