"""Regression guards for the review-quality fields and the executable-claim probe.

Each guard below pins one way the review-quality work quietly stops working. The first
four are the original set; the acceptance-criteria guards were added with that feature and
are listed in `../CLAUDE.md`.

1. `failure_scenario` stops being required, so speculative findings return. It is the
   cheapest filter there is on a claim nobody established — a reviewer that cannot name
   inputs and a wrong outcome does not have a finding.
2. `reversibility` collapses into `severity`. They are different questions: severity
   ranks urgency, reversibility decides whether it can wait. Lose the distinction and a
   cheap-now shortcut gets deferred until it is expensive, which is the exact move the
   `entrenches` floor exists to refuse.
3. The report loses its verdict, or the verdict stops being floored by `entrenches`.
4. The executable-claim probe drifts back toward "the validator runs the artifact" — a
   rule `validate-finding` cannot follow with `tools: Read`, and must not be given the
   tools to follow, since its whole input is attacker-controllable diff text.

Rule 4 is the one where a regression trades a documentation gap for an execution risk,
so its guards are behavioural where they can be: they run `probe-pattern.sh`.
