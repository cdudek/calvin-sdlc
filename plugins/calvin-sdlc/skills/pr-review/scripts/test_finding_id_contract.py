"""Guards the one invariant behind the `#N` renumbering bug: every stage that names a
finding in prose must print its persisted `findings.json` id as `F<id>`, never a
positional index. The bug was pure prose drift across the shared report contracts, so
the regression guard is a prose check — each assertion below fails on a revert to the
form the bug actually took.
