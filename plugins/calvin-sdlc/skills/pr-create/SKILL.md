# PR Creator

Creates a GitHub pull request from local changes through a complete workflow: branch creation, syntax checking, commit, PR submission, and CI monitoring. Each step respects repo-specific conventions when they exist, falling back to widely-adopted defaults.

## Core Principles

- **Repo conventions first** — always check for project-specific configuration before falling back to defaults
- **Fail fast on lint** — catch syntax errors before they reach CI
- **One clean commit** — unless the branch already has a meaningful commit history
- **Monitor and fix** — don't just create the PR and walk away; watch CI and attempt fixes

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess the Situation

Before doing anything, understand what you're working with:

```bash
# What branch are we on?
git branch --show-current

# What's the default branch?
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name

# Are there uncommitted changes?
git status --short

# Are there unpushed commits?
git log @{upstream}..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null || echo "No upstream set"

# What's the remote?
git remote get-url origin
```

Determine the state:
- **On default branch with uncommitted changes** — need to create a new branch, stage, lint, commit, push, create PR
- **On feature branch with uncommitted changes** — need to stage, lint, commit, push, create or update PR
- **On feature branch with unpushed commits** — need to push, create or update PR
- **PR already exists for this branch** — check with `gh pr view --json number 2>/dev/null`; if so, push and update the PR description

### Step 2: Create a Branch (if needed)

Only create a branch if you're on the default branch. If the user is already on a feature branch, skip this step.

**Check for repo branch naming conventions first:**

```bash
# Look for branch naming docs or config
cat .github/BRANCH_CONVENTION.md 2>/dev/null || \
cat .github/branching.md 2>/dev/null || \
cat CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null | head -100
```

If no repo-specific convention exists, follow Conventional Branch naming (see `references/conventional-branches.md`):

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Where type is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `hotfix`, `chore`, `release`

Examples:
- `feat/add-user-authentication`
- `fix/resolve-login-timeout`
- `chore/update-dependencies`

Include a ticket number if one was mentioned: `feat/issue-123-add-user-auth`

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Step 3: Stage Changes

```bash
# Review what's changed
git status
git diff --stat

# Stage specific files — avoid staging secrets or generated files
# Never stage: .env, .env.*, credentials.json, *.key, *.pem
git add <specific-files>
```

If there are no changes to stage (everything is already committed), skip to Step 5.

### Step 4: Run Syntax Checks

Before committing, catch obvious errors. Detect the project's language and run the appropriate linter. See `references/lint-commands.md` for the full lookup table.

**Detection order:**
1. Check for a `Makefile` with a `lint` target — if it exists, run `make lint`
2. Check `package.json` for a `lint` script — if it exists, run the project's package manager lint command
3. Check for language-specific config files (`.rubocop.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)
4. Fall back to common linter commands for the detected language

If linting fails:
- **Auto-fixable issues** (formatting, import order): run the auto-fix command (e.g., `npx eslint --fix`, `ruff check --fix`), then re-stage the fixed files
- **Actual errors** (syntax errors, type errors): report them to the user and stop — don't commit broken code
- **No linter available**: warn the user but proceed (not every project has linting set up)

### Step 4.5: Documentation freshness check

Before committing, check whether the staged changes will make any repo documentation stale. This step delegates to the `docs-audit` skill's diff-mode workflow (`omr-dev` plugin → `../docs-audit/references/commands/diff.md`).

**Trigger condition:** any staged file matches the *crucial-file* patterns defined for this repo in `../docs-audit/references/file-mappings.md`. If no staged file matches, skip this step.

**Procedure:**

1. Read the section for the current repo in `../docs-audit/references/file-mappings.md` (plus the generic-rules section that applies to every repo).
2. If any staged file matches a `Changed pattern` in those tables, invoke the diff-mode audit on the `staged` scope.
3. Apply findings per severity:
   - **Critical** — auto-fix the docs (the doc states something demonstrably false; correcting it is safe). Re-stage the fixed doc files so they fold into the upcoming commit. Add a one-line note to the commit body: `Doc updates: <N> file(s)`.
   - **Warning / Info** — list them to the user and ask: "Apply N? Reply `apply <ids>`, `apply all`, `skip`, or `defer` (mention in PR description)."
4. If the user picks `defer`, continue to Step 5 but include a "Pending doc updates" section in the PR description (Step 6) listing the unapplied findings.
5. If the user picks `skip`, continue with no further action.

This step is **not** a hard gate — if the audit cannot run (e.g. `git diff` is empty, or no patterns match), proceed silently to Step 5.

### Step 5: Create a Commit

**Check for repo commit conventions first:**

```bash
cat .github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md 2>/dev/null
```

If no repo-specific convention exists, follow Conventional Commits (see `../role-conventional-commits/references/format.md`):

```
<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Analyze the staged changes to determine the appropriate type:
- New files or features → `feat`
- Bug fixes → `fix`
- Dependency updates → `chore`
- Documentation → `docs`
- Refactoring → `refactor`
- Tests → `test`

Write the commit message using a HEREDOC for proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(auth): add JWT-based authentication

Implement token generation and validation middleware
for protected API routes.
EOF
)"
```

If the branch already has commits with a clear history, create an additional commit rather than amending. The goal is a clean, reviewable history — not necessarily a single commit.

### Step 6: Push and Create the PR

```bash
# Push the branch (set upstream on first push)
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

**Check for a PR template.** GitHub accepts it in the repo root, `.github/` or `docs/`, `.md` or `.txt`, in any case, plus a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory of them under each. List the candidates first, then read the one you will use:

```bash
{ find . .github docs -maxdepth 1 -type f \
    \( -iname 'pull_request_template.md' -o -iname 'pull_request_template.txt' \) 2>/dev/null
  find . .github docs -maxdepth 2 -type f -ipath '*/pull_request_template/*' 2>/dev/null
} | sort -u
```

Nothing back means no template. One path back is the template — `cat` it. Several means the repo offers a choice: GitHub applies exactly one per PR, so pick the one that fits this change and `cat` that. Never `cat` two together — concatenating them makes a body the repo never intended, with two of every heading.

**Always create PRs as drafts** (`gh pr create --draft`). A draft can't be merged and signals "not yet ready for review". The author must self-review the PR and then mark it ready (`gh pr ready` or the "Ready for review" button) themselves — that human gate is the whole point of opening as a draft. Never mark a PR ready on the user's behalf, and never skip `--draft` unless the user explicitly asks for a non-draft PR.

Documented, not enforced by a hook: the `pr-draft-gate` PreToolUse hook that used to turn a missing `--draft` into a confirmation prompt was removed on 2026-09-07 — it kept prompting the developer in sdlc-run repos, where PRs open READY on purpose. Pass `--draft` here; the developer's `gh pr ready` stays out of the allow-list (architecture guide).

**If a template exists, the template IS the body.** Start from it verbatim and fill it in: replace placeholder sections with content from the diff and commit history, keep every heading and every checklist item, and don't leave sections empty — fill them or strike them through. Never write a description of your own shape and drop the template, and never pass `--fill` in a repo that has one. A body that replaced the template is the single most common way an unverified PR reaches a reviewer: the last 30 PRs per repo had no self-review line at all in 7 (eventmanager), 11 (reviews-frontend) and 18 (reviews-api) of them. The morning PR bot reads that box, and `pr-task-check@v4` fails the required check when the item its template ships is missing from the body.

**Human-only checklist items:** if the template contains a checklist item asserting human review — e.g. "Self-reviewed PR", "I have reviewed my own changes", "self-review" — leave it **unchecked** (`- [ ]`). That box certifies a human looked at the diff; an AI tool must never tick it. The same applies to any item that asserts a human action the AI didn't actually perform. Fill in descriptive sections freely, but only check boxes for steps that were genuinely completed (and never the self-review attestation).

**If no template exists**, generate a structured description:

```bash
# Gather context for the description
git log $(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name)..HEAD --oneline
git diff $(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name)..HEAD --stat
```

Then create the PR as a draft:

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "<conventional-title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## ℹ️ Description
<1-3 bullet points describing what changed and why>

### Changes
<list of key changes, grouped logically, don't create list by commits take a look on whole PR changes in general>

)"
```

The PR title should follow the same convention as commit messages (e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT authentication`). The PR opens as a draft; tell the user to self-review and mark it ready when satisfied.

**Verify the draft state and the self-review item before reporting the PR**, so a missed flag or a dropped template surfaces instead of passing silently:

```bash
gh pr view --json isDraft,url,body \
  -q '"draft=\(.isDraft)  self_review_item=\((.body // "") | test("(?i)self[ -]?review|reviewed my own"))  \(.url)"'
```

If it comes back `draft=false`, say so explicitly in your summary — don't run `gh pr ready`'s inverse (`gh pr edit --add-label` etc.) or try to fix it silently. `gh pr ready --undo` converts it back to a draft; offer that and let the developer decide.

`self_review_item` is a smoke check, not a gate: it only says the phrase is somewhere in the body. If it comes back `false` and the repo's template has the item, the body dropped it. Fix it in the same step with `gh pr edit --body-file` — paste the template back, unticked — and say that you did.

**If a PR already exists** for this branch, push the new commits and **edit the existing description in place**. Never regenerate it: the body on that PR already holds the repo's template, the reviewer's context and any box a human ticked, and `gh pr edit --body` replaces all of it.

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

# Read the body you are about to change, and keep every heading and checklist
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json body -q .body > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pr-body.md"
```

Edit that file: extend the description sections to cover the new commits, and leave every heading, every checklist item and every ticked box exactly as they are. A box a human ticked stays ticked; the self-review box stays as you found it. Then:

```bash
gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --body-file "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pr-body.md"
```

Always return the PR URL to the user after creation or update.

### Step 7: Monitor CI

After the PR is created or updated, monitor GitHub Actions. This is a loop with a **hard limit of 3 fix iterations**.

```bash
# Wait briefly for checks to register
sleep 5

# Check status
gh pr checks $(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
```

**If all checks pass** — report success and the PR URL. Done.

**If checks are pending** — wait and re-check. Use `gh run watch` for active runs:

```bash
# Find the latest run for the PR's head SHA
RUN_ID=$(gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')
gh run watch $RUN_ID
```

**If checks fail** — attempt to diagnose and fix:

```bash
# Get failed run details
gh run view $RUN_ID --log-failed
```

For each fix iteration (max 3):
1. Read the failure logs
2. Determine if the failure is something you can fix (test failure, lint error, type error, build issue)
3. If fixable: make the fix, stage, commit with a descriptive message (e.g., `fix: resolve type error in auth middleware`), push
4. If not fixable (infrastructure issue, flaky test, external service): inform the user immediately — don't waste iterations
5. After pushing the fix, update the PR description to reflect the new commit
6. Re-check CI status

Track the iteration count explicitly. After 3 failed fix attempts:
- Stop trying
- Summarize what failed and what you attempted
- Show the user the failure logs
- Suggest next steps (e.g., "This looks like a flaky integration test — you may want to re-run it manually")

## Important Notes

- **Never force-push** unless the user explicitly asks for it
- **Never push to the default branch** — always work on a feature branch
- **Open PRs as drafts by default** — pass `--draft` to `gh pr create` unless the user explicitly asks for a ready-for-review PR
- **Never mark a PR ready for review** (`gh pr ready`) on the user's behalf — the author marks it ready after self-reviewing
- **Never tick human-attestation checklist items** — leave "Self-reviewed PR" and similar boxes unchecked for the human
- **Always confirm before creating the PR** if the user hasn't explicitly asked for one — they may just want commits
- **Keep the PR description current** — after each fix commit, update the summary so reviewers see accurate information
- The `Co-Authored-By` footer should use the model name from the current session

## Error Handling

### "gh: not found"
Cause: GitHub CLI not installed.
Solution: Tell the user to install it: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see https://cli.github.com/

### "HTTP 401" or auth errors
Cause: gh not authenticated or token expired.
Solution: Run `gh auth status`, then `gh auth login` if needed.

### No changes to commit
Cause: Working tree is clean.
Solution: Check if changes are already committed. If so, skip to Step 6 (push and create PR).

### Lint failures that can't be auto-fixed
Cause: Real syntax or type errors in the code.
Solution: Report the specific errors to the user and stop. Don't commit broken code.

### CI failures after 3 fix iterations
Cause: Persistent issue that automated fixes can't resolve.
Solution: Summarize all attempts, show logs, suggest manual investigation.
