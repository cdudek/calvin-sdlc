description: Fixes one flaky test, a test that passes and fails at random — reproduces it, bisects if possible, applies the fix, and verifies with stash-based confirmation. Use when user says "fix flaky test", "flaky spec", "test is flaky", "intermittent failure", or references a flaky-test ticket. An e2e suite that is red because the product changed is repaired by calvin-sdlc:e2e-write heal instead.

# Fix Flaky Test Skill

Reproduces, diagnoses, and fixes flaky or failing tests with a verified confirmation workflow.


## Routing

The user input is: $ARGUMENTS

Read the first word as the subcommand and route to its file, passing the rest on as arguments.

| Subcommand | Does |
|---|---|
| `local` | The user input is: $ARGUMENTS → `references/commands/local.md` |
| `ticket` | The user input is: $ARGUMENTS → `references/commands/ticket.md` |

No subcommand, or one that is not in the table: say
`Usage: /calvin-sdlc:flaky-test-fix <local | ticket>`
and ask which one they meant. Never guess — the subcommands do different things.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Understand** — gather context (from ticket or spec file)
2. **Worktree** — enter isolated worktree
3. **Detect ecosystem** — identify test runner and load ecosystem reference
4. **Reproduce** — confirm the failure, calibrate reproduction rate
5. **Bisect** — if order-dependent, use test runner bisect (ecosystem-dependent)
6. **Diagnose & fix** — identify root cause, apply minimal fix
7. **Verify** — stash-based confirmation (`../role-test-fixer/references/stash-verify.md`)
8. **Report** — structured summary (`references/report-format.md`)

## Commands

| Command | Description | Arguments |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `/calvin-sdlc:flaky-test-fix ticket` | Fix a flaky test from a Linear ticket or GitHub issue | `<ticket_id> [seed]` |
| `/calvin-sdlc:flaky-test-fix local` | Fix a flaky test from a spec file path | `<spec_path> [seed]` |

## Ecosystem Detection

Inspect the project root for framework markers:

| Marker file | Ecosystem | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `Gemfile` + `spec/` | RSpec | `references/ecosystem-rspec.md` |
| `Gemfile` + `test/` (no `spec/`) | Minitest | `references/ecosystem-minitest.md` |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | Pytest | `references/ecosystem-pytest.md` |
| `package.json` + `jest.config.*` | Jest | `references/ecosystem-jest.md` |
| `package.json` + `vitest.config.*` | Vitest | `references/ecosystem-jest.md` |
| `package.json` + `playwright.config.*` | Playwright | `references/ecosystem-playwright.md` |

**Playwright and a unit runner usually both exist.** Route by the failing spec's path, not
by the marker: a spec under the Playwright `testDir` is Playwright, everything else is the
unit runner. Browser flakes and unit flakes have different causes and different fixes.

**Disambiguation:** If both `spec/` and `test/` exist, check `Gemfile` for `rspec-rails` or `rspec` gem. If present → RSpec. Otherwise → Minitest.

Load the matching ecosystem reference before running any test commands.

For e2e reproduction and diagnosis, also read `references/controlled-diagnosis.md`: it
links the control-run and machine-load rules, classifies failures across two fixtures,
and explains temporary probe specs. Use it before attributing failures to product code.

## Principles

1. **Minimal fix** — change only what's necessary. Don't refactor surrounding code, add unrelated improvements, or "clean up" the test file.
2. **Prove causation** — the stash-based verify step is mandatory. A fix that can't be verified this way needs more investigation.
3. **One test at a time** — if a ticket references multiple flaky tests, fix them one at a time. Each gets its own verify cycle.
4. **Respect seeds** — when a seed is provided, always use it for the initial reproduction. Random seeds may mask the flaky behavior.
5. **Shared patterns** — follow the problem-solving workflow in `../role-test-fixer/PATTERNS.md`
6. **Quarantine is not a fix** — when a flaky e2e test blocks unrelated work and the fix is not quick, a person may quarantine it with an owner, a ticket and an expiry of at most 14 days (`../e2e-test-run/references/strategy.md` section 7). This skill never quarantines or skips; it fixes, or it reports.

## Policies

### Worktree
Do NOT exit the worktree — the user exits manually after interactive follow-up.

### Commits
Do NOT commit or push automatically. Present the fix and verification results — the user decides when to commit.

### Error Handling
If reproduction fails (test passes when it should fail), report this clearly and ask the user for guidance. Do not guess at the fix.
