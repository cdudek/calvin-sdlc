description: "General-purpose GitHub operations via the gh CLI — listing PRs/issues, checking CI/Actions status, merging, labeling, repo settings, raw API queries. Use when the user says 'list PRs', 'check CI', 'check actions', 'merge this PR', 'close issue', 'gh api', 'workflow status', 'list issues', or needs ad-hoc gh commands. Skip for: opening a new PR (use pr-create), reviewing PR code (use pr-review), picking up an existing PR with feedback (use address-feedback pr), cutting a release (use release-cut)."

# GitHub CLI

Always use the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations. Never use raw `curl` to the GitHub API, never construct URLs manually, and never ask the user to open a browser when `gh` can do it.


## Routing

The user input is: $ARGUMENTS

Read the first word as the subcommand and route to its file, passing the rest on as arguments.

| Subcommand | Does |
|---|---|
| `create-changelog` | Generates or updates a CHANGELOG.md file from merged PRs and git history → `references/commands/create-changelog.md` |

No subcommand, or one that is not in the table: say
`Usage: /calvin-sdlc:github-manage <create-changelog>`
and ask which one they meant. Never guess — the subcommands do different things.

## Instructions

### Core Principle

`gh` is installed and authenticated. Prefer it over:
- Raw GitHub API calls (`curl -H "Authorization: ..."`)
- Opening browser links and asking the user to click things
- Suggesting the user do something manually on github.com

### Always Provide Links

After creating or retrieving any resource (PR, issue, release, repo), always include the URL in your response so the user can navigate directly to it. Use `--json url -q .url` or extract the URL from command output.

### Pull Requests

#### Create a PR

PRs are always opened as **drafts** — `--draft` is not an option here, it's the default. Only the author marks a PR ready for review, after reading their own diff. No hook enforces it any more (removed 2026-09-07 — it kept prompting in sdlc-run repos, where PRs open ready on purpose); `gh pr ready` stays out of the allow-list, so it prompts on its own.

```bash
# From current branch — interactive title/body
gh pr create --draft

# With explicit title and body
gh pr create --draft --title "Add user auth" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Added JWT-based authentication
- New middleware for protected routes

## Test plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual login/logout flow verified

# Target a specific base branch
gh pr create --draft --base develop
```

The author flips it ready themselves (`gh pr ready`, or the "Ready for review" button). Never run that on their behalf.

#### Review a PR
```bash
# View PR details
gh pr view 123

# View diff
gh pr diff 123

# Check CI status
gh pr checks 123

# List files changed
gh pr diff 123 --name-only

# Review with inline comments (use gh api for line-level comments)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/123/comments -f body="Comment" -F path="src/file.ts" -F line=42 -f side="RIGHT" -F commit_id="$(gh pr view 123 --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)"
```

#### Merge a PR
```bash
# Merge (defaults to merge commit)
gh pr merge 123

# Squash merge
gh pr merge 123 --squash

# Rebase merge
gh pr merge 123 --rebase

# Auto-merge when checks pass
gh pr merge 123 --auto --squash
```

#### List and filter PRs
```bash
# My open PRs
gh pr list --author @me

# PRs needing review
gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me"

# PRs by label
gh pr list --label "bug"
```

### Issues

```bash
# Create an issue
gh issue create --title "Bug: login fails" --body "Steps to reproduce..."

# Create with labels and assignee
gh issue create --title "Fix auth" --label "bug,priority:high" --assignee "@me"

# List open issues
gh issue list

# View issue details
gh issue view 456

# Close an issue
gh issue close 456 --reason "completed"

# Search issues
gh issue list --search "auth error" --label "bug"
```

### GitHub Actions / CI

```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list

# View a specific run
gh run view 789

# Watch a run in progress
gh run watch 789

# View failed step logs
gh run view 789 --log-failed

# Re-run failed jobs
gh run rerun 789 --failed

# Trigger a workflow manually
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=staging
```

### Releases

```bash
# Create a release from a tag
gh release create v1.2.0 --generate-notes

# Create with custom notes
gh release create v1.2.0 --title "v1.2.0" --notes "Bug fixes and improvements"

# Draft release
gh release create v1.2.0 --draft

# List releases
gh release list

# Download release assets
gh release download v1.2.0
```

### Repository Management

```bash
# Clone a repo
gh repo clone owner/repo

# Fork a repo
gh repo fork owner/repo

# Create a new repo
gh repo create my-project --private --clone

# View repo info
gh repo view owner/repo

# Set default repo (useful in multi-remote setups)
gh repo set-default owner/repo
```

### Advanced: gh api

Use `gh api` for anything not covered by built-in commands. It handles auth automatically.

```bash
# GET request
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}

# POST with JSON body
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues -f title="New issue" -f body="Details"

# GraphQL query
gh api graphql -f query='{ viewer { login } }'

# Paginate results
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues --paginate

# Use jq for filtering
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls --jq '.[].title'
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a PR after finishing work
User says: "create a PR for this"
Actions:
1. Run `git status` and `git log` to understand changes
2. Run `gh pr create --draft` with a descriptive title and structured body
3. Return the PR URL to the user, and tell them to self-review and mark it ready when satisfied
Result: draft PR created and URL displayed

### Example 2: Check why CI is failing
User says: "why is CI failing on my PR?"
Actions:
1. Run `gh pr checks` to see which checks failed
2. Run `gh run view --log-failed` on the failed run to get logs
3. Summarize the failure and suggest a fix
Result: Root cause identified from logs

### Example 3: Review a PR
User says: "review PR 123"
Actions:
1. Run `gh pr view 123` for context
2. Run `gh pr diff 123` to read the changes
3. Post inline comments using `gh api` for line-level feedback
Result: Review with specific, inline comments on the PR

## Reusable Scripts

The `scripts/` directory ships sequential, parseable wrappers around common PR workflows. Other skills reference them via `Bash(bash */github-manage/scripts/*)`. Each script has a header comment with usage and output sections — `head -20 scripts/<name>.sh` is the source of truth.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/pr-context.sh <pr_number>` | PR metadata, commits, body, linked issues, reviews |
| `scripts/pr-diff.sh <pr_number>` | Full PR diff (separate so callers can skip the cost) |
| `scripts/pr-checks.sh <pr_number>` | Detailed CI check list (name, state, link, workflow) as JSONL |
| `scripts/pr-readiness.sh <pr_number>` | Informational mergeability state with ahead/behind staleness (no gating) |
| `scripts/pr-merge-policy.sh` | Repo's squash/merge/rebase policy and default-message rules |
| `scripts/pr-squash-merge.sh <pr_number> <subject> [--auto]` | Squash-merge with custom subject (arg) and body (stdin) |

Output sections use the `-#-#- SECTION -#-#-` convention (see CLAUDE.md scripts rule).

## Error Handling

### "gh: not found"
Cause: gh CLI not installed
Solution: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see https://cli.github.com/

### "HTTP 401" or "auth" errors
Cause: gh not authenticated or token expired
Solution: Run `gh auth status` to check, then `gh auth login` if needed

### "no default repository"
Cause: Running gh outside a git repo or remote not set
Solution: Run `gh repo set-default owner/repo` or `cd` into the repo first
