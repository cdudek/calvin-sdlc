# HeyDiff sitemap

Copied on 2026-10-29 from the approved spec sitemap, written by `omr-ux:sitemap-create` in diff mode on 2026-10-28: the earlier proposed sitemap (2026-10-27) against the new IA (`ia.md`, rewritten around the approved journey, A59). Machine copy: `sitemap.json` beside this file, 47 pages, 14 surfaces, 19 redirects, 21 mail and external links (the two waitlist pages and three mail links added on 2026-10-28, S146).

## As built

Read from `src/app/[locale]` on 2026-10-29. Six pages exist; three are stubs from the foundation work, three are the sign-in screens (1.12). Every other route is `proposed`. English is the only locale and its prefix is hidden.

| Route                     | File                                                          | Page id                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/`                       | `src/app/[locale]/(public)/page.tsx`                          | `public.landing`         |
| `/[org]/my-work`          | `src/app/[locale]/(app)/[org]/my-work/page.tsx`               | `app.my-work`            |
| `/operator/organisations` | `src/app/[locale]/(operator)/operator/organisations/page.tsx` | `operator.organisations` |
| `/sign-in`                | `src/app/[locale]/(public)/sign-in/page.tsx`                  | `auth.sign-in`           |
| `/sign-in/verify`         | `src/app/[locale]/(public)/sign-in/verify/page.tsx`           | `auth.sign-in-verify`    |
| `/account/sign-in-methods` | `src/app/[locale]/(app)/account/sign-in-methods/page.tsx`    | `account.sign-in-methods` |

Check Your Email (`/sign-in/check` in the proposed sitemap) is built as a state of `/sign-in`, not as a route of its own: `/sign-in/check` has no `page.tsx`.

The test `test/docs/sitemap.test.ts` fails when a built page is missing here.

## Proposed

**Status: proposed, 2026-10-28.** Labels are English only (release 1). Roles: owner, admin, member, guest; visitor (signed out); operator (a platform role). Locale rule unchanged: every route sits under `/[locale]`, English is the only locale, and its prefix is hidden.

### The principles it rests on

| Principle                                                                           | What it forces here                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One address per object, tenant then product then thing (`/[org]/[ws]/comments/[n]`) | Two nesting levels, a departure from RC-8 recorded once (F16 of the earlier sitemap, kept). The journey's address bar shows `/kestrel-shop/comments`; read as the workspace part of the path |
| One list per object, status as a filter                                             | Comments is one list with a Status filter, not four status lists. Decisions, Revisions and Sessions are their own objects, so their own lists                                                |
| Every list's filters, grouping and search live in the URL (nuqs)                    | `?status=`, `?commit=`, `?people=`, `?group=` and the rest; defaults omitted                                                                                                                 |
| Tabs that filter one list are query params                                          | Inbox `kind`, My Work `tab`, Decisions and Revisions `status`                                                                                                                                |
| Create is a dialog; the one create page is `/welcome`                               | Start a Decision, Share Session, Invite People, New Workspace add no history entry                                                                                                           |
| No access and not found look the same                                               | A link never reveals what exists                                                                                                                                                             |
| Redirects are additive; a renamed slug keeps redirecting                            | Old organisation and workspace slugs stay reserved for good                                                                                                                                  |
| A label is the route's word                                                         | "Connected Apps" at `/account/connected-apps`; "Revisions" at `/revisions`                                                                                                                   |

### Reserved first segments

`blog`, `privacy`, `terms`, `imprint`, `waitlist`, `sign-in`, `sign-out`, `invite`, `authorize`, `welcome`, `account`, `operator`, `api`, `mcp`, `internal`, `help`, `settings`, `new`, `.well-known`, and every locale code.

### Hosts

This table is the one place hosts are named (A72: "Cloud Run from release 1"; A65: "I bought the domain."). Every other file links here. Each host serves every area (public, sign-in, app, account, operator, `/api`, `/mcp`) on one origin; no `app.` subdomain (S145).

| Host                                | Who uses it                                                             | Runs on                                                                                                                                    | Mail                                                          | MCP address                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `https://heydiff.com`               | everyone: production                                                    | Cloud Run service `heydiff-web`, project `heydiff`, europe-west1, Cloud SQL; domain mapping (A81); scales to zero, no warm instance (A66)  | sent from `noreply@heydiff.com` (S145)                        | `https://heydiff.com/mcp`   |
| staging's private `run.app` address | the owner and invited testers, signed in with an allowed Google account | Cloud Run service `heydiff-web-staging`, same project; scales to zero; not indexed (`noindex`); previews are tagged revisions of it (S163) | sent from `noreply@heydiff.com`, subject prefixed "[Staging]" | `{staging address}/mcp`     |
| `http://localhost:3000`             | development on the owner's Mac                                          | `next dev` and the developer's database from `make dev-db` (S166)                                                                          | printed to the terminal (`console` provider)                  | `http://localhost:3000/mcp` |

- Mail links, the MCP address in Connect an Agent, the extension's server and the phone all use the host the person is on. Nothing names a host in a string; screens read it from the server's config as `{host}`.
- The extension's build names its server: the release build uses `heydiff.com`, a staging build the staging host, a dev build localhost (S145).
- The DNS host for `heydiff.com` is still open (A65); it changes nothing here.
- The first request after an idle spell waits for a cold start. Every action already shows its busy state, so nothing else is added (S145). `device` is released: no device-code page exists (A35). Reserved workspace slugs: `inbox`, `my-work`, `settings`, `billing`, `integrations`, `new`.

Narrow screens: a 56 px rail under 1100 px (⌘\), a drawer on a phone. **Command menu:** every page above, a comment by number (`#118`), settings pages, switching workspace, actions on this page.

**Gone from the navigation:** Open, Needs Decision, In Review, Done (replaced by the Status filter, Decisions and Revisions); Modules (a filter now, managed in Workspace Settings › Modules).

### Operator navigation

Unchanged: Waitlist, Invitations, Organisations, Users, Feature Flags, Usage; header Back to App.

### Settings

Unchanged, except Account › Devices is now Account › Connected Apps.

| SM-2 orphan                               | pass. Exempt: reserved `/blog`, billing, integrations; `/sign-in/verify` and `/authorize` are entered from mail or another app   |
| SM-3 fewer than two ways in               | Sessions list has one visible way in (sidebar, once one exists) plus ⌘K; accepted, as before for operator pages                  |
| SM-4 one object at two addresses          | pass: the extension's "Open in HeyDiff" lands on the same canonical addresses                                                    |
| SM-5 deeper than three levels             | pass: deepest are `/comments/[n]`, `/decisions/[n]`, `/sessions/[id]`, `/settings/[page]`                                        |
| SM-6 record without one canonical address | pass                                                                                                                             |
| SM-7 label differs                        | pass after renaming Devices; the journey's "Implemented" and "Voting" chips are image faults, the words are Revised and Deciding |
| SM-8 tab with no header primary decision  | pass: every page above names its primary or none                                                                                 |
| SM-9 list state not in the URL            | pass                                                                                                                             |
| SM-10 route convention                    | F16 kept (two nesting levels); nothing new                                                                                       |
| SM-11 moved address without a redirect    | pass: every earlier-plan address has one                                                                                         |
| SM-12 mail lands elsewhere than its words | pass                                                                                                                             |

## Findings for the spec

- **F17 (new): the journey's address bar shows one segment.** Images show `app.snapmark.dev/kestrel-shop/comments`. The sitemap keeps `/[org]/[ws]/…` so an organisation can hold several workspaces. Recorded as default S1.
- **F18 (new): My Work and Sessions are not drawn in the sidebar.** The journey's sidebar shows Inbox, Comments, Decisions, Revisions. Both are kept, Sessions only once one exists (default S3).
- F1 to F16 of the earlier sitemap are folded in or kept as written; F3, F10 and F14 no longer apply (modules list gone, Agent decided, module tabs gone).
