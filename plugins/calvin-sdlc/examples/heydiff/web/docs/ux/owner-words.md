# The owner's words

Every request the owner has made about HeyDiff, the team service, verbatim, dated. Quote from this file; never cite a request by number. Grouped by day, in the order asked. The source is the chat or dialog of that day.

The Mac app's own requests are in `heydiff-desktop/docs/ux/owner-words.md`. Decisions the owner answered on the spec's defaults are in `changes/2026-10-27-online-release-1/spec/owner-decisions.md`, and each lasting decision has its own file in `docs/designs/`.

## States and feedback (2026-10-29)

> "do we have rulesets on loading e.g. when and what e.g. when using skeleton, progress bar, or spinner? if not we should define this. this is essential for good ux. same for toast messages, different states including empty, as well as error handling. I want this defined and always taken care of."

## States and feedback, review of the first draft (2026-10-29)

The owner's annotation on `interaction-guidelines.md`, binding. The revised section tags the rules it settled "owner, 2026-10-29".

> I’d resolve these before making it binding:
>
> 1. **A new toast must not remove someone’s recovery option.**  
> TOA-7 explicitly removes the previous Undo when another toast appears. Reopen covers Resolve, but the inventory also includes Delete Comment and Discard. Copying a link could therefore remove the only way to recover discarded work. Keep recovery available independently of the toast. Also reconcile replacement with “Problem stays until closed.” A timed action without an equivalent untimed alternative needs particular care under [WCAG’s timing guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html).
>
> 2. **A failed reply must not overwrite the next draft.**  
> In the example, Ben’s failed reply returns to the composer after a timeout. What if he has already started another reply? WEB-6’s approach—keeping the failed item with Try Again—is safer. Preserve each submission separately; restoring one to the composer must preserve anything already there.
>
> 3. **Rewrite the loading table so its branches do not overlap.**  
> “Pick the first row that fits” currently selects:
> - Known-layout skeletons before the existing-content refresh case.
> - Busy buttons before optimistic updates.
> - Earlier cases before the “over 10 seconds” case.
>
> Separate **operation type** from **elapsed time**, and explicitly exempt immediate button feedback from the 400 ms delay. Similarly, EMP-8’s “loading, error, empty, content” order needs an exception for refreshing existing content: a failed refresh should retain the readable content and show its error alongside it.
>
> 4. **Define what a timeout actually means.**  
> LOD-11 promises an error at 30 seconds, while ERR-4 allows three retries and ERR-5 gives a request 30 seconds. Specify one overall waiting budget. For writes, distinguish *confirmed failure* from *no confirmation received*: the server may have saved a reply even though the response never arrived. The same-key retry rule is useful, but needs reconciliation of late responses and a rule for edited retry payloads.
>
> 5. **Give navigation and shortcuts explicit precedence.**  
> Three conflicts need a direct answer:
> - WEB-2 restores the focused row on Back; LOD-13 moves focus to the page heading.
> - EDT-5 uses ⌘Z for drawings; TOA-9 uses it for the visible toast.
> - WEB-3 treats Esc as a history pop, but a directly opened detail page may have no list behind it.
>
> Define which interaction owns the key and focus. For a directly opened detail page, provide a known list destination.
>
> 6. **Strengthen the accessibility checks.**  
> Checking at 100% and 150% leaves gaps. Add 200% text resizing and reflow at 320 CSS pixels, with applicable exceptions for genuinely two-dimensional content. Those are the relevant [WCAG resize and reflow requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow). Also, LOD-8’s blanket 60% opacity can undermine the contrast promised by ACC-3. Keep readable text at compliant contrast and indicate refresh separately.
>
> 7. **Separate rule status from proof of compliance.**  
> “Proposed,” “approved,” “awaiting confirmation,” and “in force until the owner answers” leave implementers unsure what governs. Give each rule a clear approval status and state which rules take precedence.
>
> Likewise, an E2E test title proves that a state is registered, not that its behavior works. Require assertions for preservation, recovery, focus and transitions. Resolve the smaller inconsistency between allowing an ancestor error boundary and requiring an error file in every route.
>
> I’d add four worked examples to make these decisions concrete: **two quick destructive actions; a reply failing while another is being written; a refresh failing with content already visible; and Esc from a directly opened detail page.** Each should specify what remains visible, what survives, where focus goes, and how recovery works.
