# Usage: ac-verify-evidence.sh <review_root> <ac-coverage.json>
#
# Checks that every acceptance criterion graded `covered` or `partial` cites code that is
# really there: the quoted text must occur in the cited file, and the cited line must exist.
# Deterministic — it reads files and compares strings, and calls no model.
#
# Why a quote and not just a location. In the findings pipeline `evidence` is verbatim code
# and `validate-finding` checks it sits at the cited line; that is what makes a finding
# falsifiable. An AC row used to carry only `file:line`, so "is the evidence non-empty" was
# the only check anyone could write, and a fabricated `covered` citing an unrelated place
# passed every one of them. A quote can be checked against the file. This closes fabrication.
#
# What it does NOT do: judge whether the quoted code has anything to do with the criterion.
# That needs a model. `ac-check.md` records it as the open half.
#
# Input — <ac-coverage.json>, as `ac-check.md` collects it from the ac-auditor agent:
#   {"ac":[{"id","text","status","evidence":[{"file","line","quote"}],"note"}]}
#
# Rules, in the order they fail:
#   * `covered`                  must carry at least one evidence entry
#   * `missing`                  must carry none
#   * every entry, any status    `file` resolves INSIDE <review_root> (model output shaped by
#                                untrusted ticket text never reads outside the tree)
#   * every entry, any status    the file exists, `line` is 1..<lines in file>, and `quote`
#                                occurs in the file as a fixed string
#
# Output sections:
#   -#-#- AC_EVIDENCE -#-#-
#   - rows: <graded rows>
#   - entries: <evidence entries checked>
#   - ok: yes|no
#   - problem: <AC-n: what failed>   (one line per failure, only when ok is no)
#
# Exit: 0 every entry checks out, 1 any did not, 2 bad input.
