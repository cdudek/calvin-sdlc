# Usage: fix-handoff.sh <findings.json> <verdicts.json>
#
# Buckets validated pr-review findings by disposition for a fix consumer
# (review-fix-loop's extra-validation-runner). Joins each finding to its
# validator verdict and routes by (verdict, suppressed_reason, severity,
# reversibility). Prints a JSON object to stdout. Used by the
# extra-validation-runner, which re-validates the `recheck` bucket before
# anything reaches the fix stage.
#
# Inputs (from pr-review's $STATE_DIR):
#   <findings.json>  {"findings":[{id,file,line,severity,confidence,dimension,source,
#                     self_proving,evidence,body,failure_scenario,reversibility,
#                     validation_effort,idiomatic_fix?,suppressed_reason?,...}]}
#   <verdicts.json>  [{id,verdict:"confirmed"|"unverifiable"|"rejected",...}]
#
#   The buckets carry WHOLE finding objects, unprojected — every field above, and any
#   field added later, reaches the fix consumer. extra-validation-runner reads
#   `reversibility` and `idiomatic_fix` from here for fix-set.json.
#
# Routing:
#   fix_now  — verdict=confirmed AND NOT out-of-scope AND it blocks the verdict:
#              severity is anything but `suggestion`/`nit`, OR reversibility=entrenches.
#              Same floor as report-sections.md -> Verdict "What blocks", so the loop
#              fixes what would block a ship and reports the rest.
#   discuss  — verdict=confirmed AND (out-of-scope, OR below that blocking floor)
#   recheck  — verdict=unverifiable (re-validated harder by the extra-validation-runner)
#   drop     — verdict=rejected (demonstrably wrong)
#   A finding with no matching verdict defaults to `recheck` (safe — never silently fixed).
#
#   BOTH fields are case-folded. Only `severity` was, and an `Entrenches` from a reviewer
#   then failed the comparison silently: the finding fell back to severity alone and a
#   `suggestion` carrying the one axis that outranks severity routed to `discuss`.
#
#   The severity test is INVERTED on purpose — it names what does NOT block, so an
#   unknown severity (`blocker`, `high`, a future value) routes to fix_now rather than
#   being silently demoted. Erring toward fixing is the safe direction here.
#
# Output: {"fix_now":[...],"recheck":[...],"discuss":[...],"drop":[{id}]}
