## 1. Playwright Test Framework

### Installation

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
# or add to existing project:
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

Install specific browsers only:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps    # Include OS dependencies (for CI)
```

### Project Structure

The OMR layout. `install-lint.sh` writes the files marked *installed*.

```
project/
  playwright.config.ts
  e2e/
    journeys.md                 # the journey inventory (installed template)
    personas.md                 # who signs in, with which helper (installed template)
    plans/                      # Markdown plans from the planner, one per surface
    fixtures/                   # persona sign-in, data factories, readiness checks
    i18n.ts                     # t(): copy resolved from the app's catalogue (installed)
    tokens.ts                   # resolveToken(): design tokens, not hex (installed)
    eslint.config.e2e.mjs       # the lint preset (installed)
    <journey>.spec.ts           # one spec file per journey
  test-results/                 # run output, gitignored
  playwright-report/            # HTML report, gitignored
```

### Configuration Reference

```typescript

  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 1 : 0,                 // one retry; a pass on retry is flaky, not green
  timeout: 30000,

  // Reporting
  reporter: 'html',

## 3. Playwright CLI Tool (`@playwright/cli`)

Standalone shell-based browser automation for AI coding agents. Uses plain commands instead of MCP protocol. ~4x more token-efficient than MCP.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli
- **NPM:** `@playwright/cli`
- **Requires:** Node.js 18+

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli install --skills    # Install agent integration
```

### Key Commands

```bash
# Navigation
playwright-cli open [url]
playwright-cli goto <url>
playwright-cli go-back / go-forward
playwright-cli reload
playwright-cli close

# Interaction
playwright-cli click <ref>
playwright-cli type <text>
playwright-cli fill <ref> <text>
playwright-cli select <ref> <value>
playwright-cli hover <ref>
playwright-cli check / uncheck <ref>

# Screenshots & output
playwright-cli snapshot                    # Accessibility tree snapshot
playwright-cli screenshot [ref]
playwright-cli pdf

# Tabs
playwright-cli tab-list / tab-new / tab-close / tab-select

# Storage
playwright-cli state-save / state-load
playwright-cli cookie-list / cookie-get / cookie-set / cookie-clear

# Debugging
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli network
playwright-cli run-code <js>
playwright-cli tracing-start / tracing-stop

# Session management
playwright-cli list                        # List sessions
playwright-cli -s=name open <url>          # Named session
playwright-cli show                        # Monitoring dashboard
```

### MCP vs CLI Comparison

| Aspect | MCP Server | CLI Tool |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Token usage | ~114K tokens/task | ~27K tokens/task |
| Protocol | MCP (JSON-RPC) | Shell commands |
| State | Persistent browser context | Named sessions |
| Best for | Autonomous systems, exploratory | High-throughput coding agents |
| Setup | JSON config in MCP client | `npm install -g` |

## 4. Playwright Test Agents (v1.56+)

**Not used at OMR.** Documented so you recognise them; `SKILL.md` ("Two upstream tools OMR
does not use") says why. Their healer may mark a test `fixme`, which our healer must never
do. Use `cct:e2e-write` instead.

### Setup

```bash
npx playwright init-agents --loop=claude     # Claude Code
npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode     # VS Code (requires v1.105+)
npx playwright init-agents --loop=opencode   # OpenCode
```

Regenerate agent definitions whenever Playwright updates.

### Generated Structure

```
project/
  .github/agents/          # Agent definitions (VS Code) or agents/ (Claude)
  specs/                   # Markdown test plans from planner
  tests/
    seed.spec.ts           # Seed file — your control point
    feature/
      scenario.spec.ts     # Generated tests
```

### Agent Pipeline

1. **Planner** — explores app via accessible tree, outputs markdown specs
2. **Generator** — converts specs to tests, verifies locators live
3. **Healer** — runs tests, debugs failures, adds FIXME for app bugs

Each agent can run independently or be chained.

### REPL Loops (Experimental)

A bash loop that chains plan -> generate -> heal without human intervention. Currently experimental — the Playwright team plans to build loops directly into agents.

---

## 5. Authentication

A spec signs in as a declared persona (`e2e/personas.md`, locator policy section 6). Where
the project has no persona helper yet, this is the upstream pattern:

1. A **setup project** signs in once and saves the browser state.
2. **Test projects** depend on it and reuse the saved state; nothing logs in twice.
3. Credentials stay in environment variables. The agent never reads them.

```
playwright.config.ts
  projects:
    - name: 'setup', testMatch: '*.setup.ts'
    - name: 'chromium', dependencies: ['setup'], use: { storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json' }

.gitignore
  playwright/.auth/
```

- **Several roles:** one state file per role (`admin.json`, `viewer.json`), chosen per test
  with `test.use({ storageState: 'playwright/.auth/admin.json' })`.
- **Signed out:** `test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } })`.
- **Faster:** sign in through the API with `APIRequestContext`, or write the session row
  directly when the real login (OAuth, magic link) cannot be driven, and say so in
  `e2e/personas.md`.

---

## 6. Configuration, CI and debugging

```typescript
defineConfig({
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,       // a stray .only fails CI
  retries: process.env.CI ? 1 : 0,    // one retry; a pass on retry is reported flaky, not green
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL ?? 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
  },
  webServer: {                        // the production build, never the dev server
    command: 'npm run build && npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

- Run on Linux and install only what runs: `npx playwright install chromium --with-deps`.
- Shard with `--shard=1/3` once each worker has its own data (strategy.md section 6); a
  shared database makes sharding a source of flakes.
- Lint specs with `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` and run `tsc --noEmit`: a
  missing `await` is the most common silent race.
- Upload the HTML report and traces as CI artifacts.

| Debugging | Command |
|---|---|
| Step through | `npx playwright test path/to.spec.ts:12 --debug` |
| Interactive tree, watch mode | `npx playwright test --ui` |
| Trace of a CI failure | `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip` or `npx playwright show-report` |
| Ask a model | the **Copy prompt** button in the HTML report or trace viewer copies the accessibility tree, the source and the error |
