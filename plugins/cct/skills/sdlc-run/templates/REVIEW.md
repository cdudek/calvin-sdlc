# Review instructions

Read by `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` once per non-bot pull request (and again on
the `re-review` label), and by anyone reviewing by hand. The human reviewer's job is intent and risk — does the change do what
`changes/<date>-<slug>/plan.md` says, and is the blast radius acceptable. The
mechanical passes below are Claude's job, and they run identically on every PR.

This CI review stays one cheap pass. The deep code review (`cct:pr-review` with one
`review-fix-loop` round) runs once per milestone, on the milestone diff, not on each feature PR.

## Passes

Read the diff once; tag every finding with one of these three passes. Open a file only
when the diff alone cannot settle a finding — never walk the repo, the budget is ~$1:

- **Bugs** — logic errors, broken edge cases, subtle regressions, a guard that no longer
  short-circuits, a summary that counts skips as successes.
- **Security** — credentials or PII in logs or error messages, a secret outside the
  secret store, a client without a timeout, a swallowed exception, a new network
  egress, a widened permission in a workflow, an auth check that trusts client input.
- **Compliance** — the change matches the change folder when the PR names one. Check every
  fact, the plan's files list, and for UI changes: `spec/screens.md` labels, controls and
  layout; `spec/interaction.md` state tables and Back behaviour; `spec/ia.md` navigation
  moves; `spec/conformance.md` component decisions and deliberate inconsistencies. A departure
  with no `## Revisions` line is **Important**. It also follows `CLAUDE.md` and does not make a
  repo rule false without updating it.

## What Important means here

Reserve **Important** for a finding that would break behaviour, write to the wrong
system, leak data, or breach a rule a guardrail test does not already catch. Style,
naming, and "I would have done it differently" are **Nits**.

## Cap the nits

Report at most five nits per review; summarise the rest as a count.

## Do not report

- Anything CI already enforces: formatting, lint rules, type checks, the guardrail tests.
  If it would fail there, it is not a finding here.
- Generated files: lockfiles, image-tag bumps, `changes/**/interview*.json`,
  `changes/**/facts-*.json`, `changes/**/*annotations*.json`.
- Comment density or prose style in code comments — this repo explains its scars on
  purpose.

## Output

Inline comments on the exact lines for every Important finding and for the nits you keep.
One top-level comment with the tally in this exact shape on its own line, so the merge
gate can read it:

    IMPORTANT: <n>  NITS: <m>  SHA: <head sha>
