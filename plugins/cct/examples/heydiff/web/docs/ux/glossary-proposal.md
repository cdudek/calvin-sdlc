# HeyDiff glossary proposal

Every term the HeyDiff team service shows, and the one word for it. One word per meaning and one meaning per word, in every screen, email, extension string and agent reply (A10, WRD-4).

**A proposal until the owner accepts it.** The terms and the alias table come from the approved information architecture of change 2026-10-27-online-release-1 (`ia.md`, objects and alias table). "Agent" as the label and "Copilot" as an alias that never shows is the owner's decision of 2026-10-28 (A32).

The Mac app keeps its own glossary proposal in `heydiff-desktop/docs/ux/glossary-proposal.md`. The cross-product word map is still to write; see the open question at the end.

**Checks.** `test/docs/glossary.test.ts` fails when a term of the information architecture is missing from "Terms", when "Agent" loses its alias, or when `messages/en.json` uses a product word that this file does not name.

**Deliberate inconsistency.** The extension's visibility menu and side panel offer two status sets (Not Resolved, Resolved) while a comment has five statuses. "Not Resolved" is Open, Deciding, In Progress and Revised, and it is the default of the web Status filter too. "Open" always names the one status (C6).

## Writing a new product word

1. Add the term here with its meaning and any rejected words, in the same change as the string that uses it.
2. Add the string to `microcopy.md` and `messages/en.json`.
3. Run `npx vitest run test/docs/glossary.test.ts`. A product word missing here fails it.

## Open questions

- The cross-product word map (HeyDiff for Mac against the team service): Comment, General comment, Note, Mark. Default: the web uses Comment; the Mac app keeps its words until the owner decides. Owner to confirm.
